# Purpose of the work
To learn the concepts of entropy per source symbol and its redundancy, to study and
compare different models of open text sources for approximate determination of
entropy, to acquire practical skills in estimating entropy per source symbol.

# Problem statement
It is necessary to develop software for counting the frequencies of letters and digrams in the text, as well as calculating the entropy values H₁ and H₂. Analyse the text before and after removing spaces and evaluate the redundancy of the Russian language.
